                        <h3 id="ai---promises-and-un-promises">AI - Promises And Un-Promises</h3>
                        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the defining technologies of our age. Its progress,
                            especially in the last decade, has been remarkable. Aided by abundant data, cheaper compute,
                            and advances in algorithms and hardware, the sub-field of Deep Learning (DL) has enabled
                            machines to reach human-level performance on specific tasks such as image classification,
                            speech recognition, gameplay in games such as Go and DoTA, and several others. Tech
                            corporations have earned enormous commercial success in deploying AI in ubiquitously used
                            products and services.</p>
                        <p>This progress of AI is expected to continue robustly. Fuelled by increasing investment in
                            research and development, more talent is focussing on technical advances in AI. Also, our
                            data sources continue to grow richer with more people joining the internet and more sensors
                            sensing our physical world. Tasks as varied as designing drugs, driving vehicles, composing
                            music, and simulating ecosystems are expected to benefit from increasing automation with
                            advances in AI. This is the promise of AI.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h3> “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” </h3>
                            <p style="text-align: right;"> — Arthur Clarke </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>With this backdrop, AI technology to most of us would appear magical, in the sense of
                            Clarke’s famous third law. And magic naturally invokes an other-worldly awe. A magical AI is
                            expected to be potentially all-powerful: We expect AI to understand language as we do, or
                            have an open-ended conversation with us, or provide emotional support, or even take away
                            half our jobs. No, there is no conclusive evidence that any of this is happening,
                            immediately or in the near future. Even technically, there are valid debates ongoing on
                            whether DL is reaching a plateau and needs to be supplemented with other methods such as
                            symbol manipulation. So, AI is not a panacea. It is a tool, that is becoming ever more
                            sophisticated. Reading it as anything more than that can detract focus from the tactical
                            efforts of deploying the tool in the service of humanity.</p>
                        <p>Vaani is founded with this tactical focus. We aim to build AI solutions to the problems
                            of Bharat, today. We aim to bridge the wide gap between demonstrated AI technologies and our
                            real-world challenges across domains of agriculture, healthcare, smart cities, digital
                            India, and sustainability. Apart from bringing the latest technologies to these domains, the
                            promise of AI can uncover data troves in these domains. These troves of data can drive
                            efficiency, transparency, and equity. This is the promise of Vaani.</p>

                        <h3 id="setting-up-the-ai-platform">Setting-up the AI Platform</h3>
                        <p>Platforms at Indian railway stations are happening places. The government sets up these
                            platforms - the concrete structures, but then others come and setup book stalls, food
                            stalls, water depots, porter services, and even WiFi services (recently setup by Google).
                            This is the power of platforms: They have a simple beginning, but evolve remarkably over
                            time as they are designed for participation and open innovation.</p>
                        <table style="border: none;">
                            <tr>
                                <td>
                                    <p>
                                        These design principles of the railways platform are our design principles in
                                        Vaani. We are a platform, our concrete structures comprise of (a) emergent
                                        networks for domain experts to connect with AI engineers, (b) efficient
                                        processes for AI engineers to collaborate on projects, and (c) accessible
                                        resources for learning about AI. This platform then becomes an invitation for
                                        government bodies, engineers, academicians, and domain experts to pool in their
                                        expertise to build concrete solutions. The diversity and engagement across this
                                        diverse group will dictate the vitality and the impact of Vaani.
                                    </p>
                                </td>
                                <td width="40%">

                        </table>
                        <p>And then there is the matter of nation building being a team sport. A sport where the role of
                            government is best as a facilitator. Vaani’s members representing an empowered group
                            within the nation, are expected to lead this effort of nation building. Each member of this
                            group will have their respective passions of contributing to the nation shaped by their
                            experience and expertise. The rise of AI provides an occasion and reason to pool together
                            these passions and direct it at solving concrete problems. Vaani is thus a platform, on
                            the journey to nation building.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h3 id="our-targets">Our Targets</h3>
                        <p>Futurist Ray Kurzweil famously said, “fundamental measures of information technology follow
                            predictable and exponential trajectories”. We do not see this is as an absolute law, but
                            there is more than a grain of truth in that statement demonstrated by Ray’s 86% success in
                            his predictions.</p>
                        <p>Vaani is challenged to succeed with this predictable and exponential trajectory. We
                            expect significant initial effort in setting up the said structures of our platform, in
                            getting the first projects out. But we aim to benefit from the law of accelerating returns
                            in the number of volunteering AI engineers and engaging domain experts, in the number of
                            solutions we are able to demonstrate, in the number of countrymen we are able to impact.</p>
                        <p>While a trend provides a fashion, an outfit needs specific targets. Here are our targets for
                            the first year of Vaani:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Grow to a community of 100 selected AI experts and 50 engaged domain experts.</li>
                            <li>Establish best practices in collaborating-in-the-wild on problem discovery and building
                                AI solutions.</li>
                            <li>Deploy at least 3 solutions in the wild targeting 3 different domains of focus.</li>
                            <li>Author 25 definitive pieces chronicling opportunities and experiences in practical
                                deployment of AI in India.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <hr>
                        <h3 id="four-functions">Four Functions</h3>
                        <p>We believe that the pace of innovation in AI for good can be significantly increased by
                            systematising the process of <strong>problem discovery</strong> and <strong>solution
                                engineering</strong> . In addition, there is need for <strong>education</strong> and
                            robust <strong>commentary</strong> . Vaani is built around these four functions:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Discover - Problem Finding</strong><br>
                                    Problems exist in the real world and datasets exist in silos, both generally
                                    inaccessible to AI engineers. Vaani is a platform for problem discovery wherein
                                    organisations and individuals post templated problem statements, provide
                                    accompanying datasets, and identify the corresponding value generated. Each problem
                                    is accompanied by community-led discussion to refine the problem statement and find
                                    connections with other problems or datasets.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Build - Solution Engineering</strong><br>
                                    A large success of AI has been due to democratised technology. However, the effect
                                    of this democratisation is not readily accessible to problem solvers on the ground.
                                    Just as our IT industry succeeded in software engineering at scale, for AI
                                    solutioning we need to build the right processes: processes which enable distributed
                                    and cross-cutting teams to innovate effectively on AI solutions. This function will

                                    With the number of research papers in AI and related areas growing exponentially, it
                                    is hard for even researchers to keep pace with the latest findings. There is thus an
                                    acute need for innovations in pedagogy and delivery to ensure that engineers
                                    constantly update their practical and theoretical knowledge on AI. Beyond this,
                                    access should be provided to domain experts and policy makers on broadly
                                    understanding the technology and its potential impact. Misunderstanding the
                                    technology is a reality, and this can be very counterproductive.</p>

                                    Framing opinion about AI at all levels - for the general public, domain experts,
                                    technologists, programmers, and government - is of high significance. We aim to
                                    robustly review the state of current adoption and future opportunities in domains
                                    such as healthcare, agriculture, vernacular languages, and finance. For instance,
                                    what are the opportunities of deploying AI to enhance the world’s largest employer
                                    the Indian Railways? Questions like these need to be definitively answered. Further,
                                    we also aim to provide balanced perspectives on topics such as AI ethics, potential
                                    job losses, and role of governance in AI.</p>

                                        today. This requires careful and constant balancing between state-of-the-art
                                        techniques with practical domain knowledge and deployment. The latter is at

                                        Vaani aims to create significant network effects in innovation in AI. This
                                        requires that people from different organisations and backgrounds join the
                                        community, have an effective communication, and build consensus on action plans.
                                        We will always prioritise open innovation with the imperative of the greater
                                        good.

                                        development and the gravity/scale of challenges Bharat faces. This requires
                                        thinking big and setting the right goals to work towards as a community. We will
                                        also build processes and platforms to benefit from the exponentiation power that
                                        comes with more data and partners.
